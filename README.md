## Filtering

These files are filtered to show phenotype comorbidities with Prevalence Ratio >= 10 and Cohort Patients >= 20. Excel can be used to explore other filtering.

In Excel select *Data* | *Filter* to remove filters.

## No Filters

In Excel select *Data* | *Filter* to remove filters. The data will appear in descending cohort prevalence order (ascending prevalene rank order).

This version of the files was used to create Tables 4-6 in the paper.

## Hidden Columns

Excel hidden columns used to explore prevalence comparisons:

* Base Prevalence Rank
* Prevalence Shift
* Prevalence Rank Shift
* Log2 Prevalene Ratio

In Excel select whole table | right click on spreasheet | Select **Unhide** to view all columns.

**Note**:  While three digits are shown after decimal point in prevalences, not all digits may be significant. This is a practical compromise to avoid using scientific notation in only some cells to show proper significant digits.
